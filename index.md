## About Me
I am an associate professor in School of Computing at University of Georgia. Before joining UGA, I was a postdoctoral research associate working in Prof. [Daniel Kifer](https://www.cse.psu.edu/~duk17)'s machine learning lab at PennState university. I received my Ph.D. in computer science in 2014 from [Purdue university](https://www.cs.purdue.edu), where I studied privacy-preserving data analysis techniques under the supervision of Prof. [Chris Clifton](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/clifton). Before joining Purdue, I was a member of database group at Yonsei university where I obtained my master and bachelor degrees in Computer Science. During my master study, I did research on developing efficient stream mining algorithms for high-dimensional data streams under the supervision of Prof. [Won Suk Lee](https://database.yonsei.ac.kr). 

## Research Interests

- **Numerical Optimization:** convex/nonconvex stochastic optimization, large-scale optimization for ML
- **Machine Learning:** deep learning, generative models, LLM fine-tuning
- **Statistical Privacy** differential privacy, privacy-preserving statistical estimation
